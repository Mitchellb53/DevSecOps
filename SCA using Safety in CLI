Safety is used to scan python dependencies for vulnerabilities

For all DevSecOps work, testing should be conducted locally before any changes are made to the CICD pipeline 

First clone the git repository to make a local version 

git clone https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/django.nv webapp

Change into the application code 

cd webapp

Install safety using this code 

pip3 install safety==2.3.5

We can explore what options safety provide using safety check --help

The scanner can then be run using 

safety check -r requirements.txt --json | tee safety-output.json

where -r is the flag for the input file and --json specifies the output to be a JSON format
