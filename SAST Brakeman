Download the source code

git clone https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/rails.git webapp

Let’s cd into the application so we can scan the app.

cd webapp

Install Brakeman

Basically, our system doesn’t have Ruby installed, let’s update apt first.

apt update

Then, let’s install Ruby with the following command.

apt install ruby-full -y

Let’s install the Brakeman tool to perform static analysis.

gem install brakeman -v 5.2.1

We have successfully installed Brakeman, let’s explore the functionality it provides us.

brakeman -h

Run the Scanner
As we have learned in DevSecOps Gospel, we would like to store the content in a JSON file. We are using the tee command here to show the output and store it in a file simultaneously.

brakeman -f json | tee result.json

Brakeman ran successfully, and it found 19 security issues.

Six issues with confidence level Medium
Eleven issues with confidence level High
It seems we have found quite a few issues; you can ignore issues with using the brakeman.ignore file.

You will find fingerprints in the scan output.

create this brakeman.ignore file.

cat > brakeman.ignore <<EOF
{
    "ignored_warnings": [
        {
          "fingerprint": "febb21e45b226bb6bcdc23031091394a3ed80c76357f66b1f348844a7626f4df",
          "note": "ignore XSS"
        }
    ]
}
EOF

Let’s re-run the scanner.

brakeman -f json -i brakeman.ignore | tee result.json
