First download source code 
git clone (source code url) 

Then change into Image directory 
cd django.nv 

Read the dockerfile which contains image construction instructions
cat Dockerfile

A dockerfile contains these components

FROM	Initialize an operating system that will be used as a base
COPY	Copy files or directories from the host to the container
WORKDIR	Sets the working directory similar to cd command on Linux
RUN	Execute commands in the current image


We can build the image using this command 
docker build -t django.nv:1.0 .

Once the image has been built we can see it using docker images 

To rename an image we can use docker tag function 
docker tag django.nv:1.0 django.nv:1.1

You can also overwrite the entry point of the application by using --entrypoint. If an entrypoint is already established it can be changed within the dockerfile and edited accordingly 
docker run --name webserver -it --entrypoint /bin/bash django.nv:1.0

To remove an image rmi is used (the container must be exited and potentially stopped before being removed)  
docker rmi django.nv:1.0
