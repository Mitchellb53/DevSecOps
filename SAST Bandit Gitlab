Notes
The above option mounts the current directory in the host (runner) to /src inside the container. This could also be -v /home/ubuntu/code:/src or c:\users\code:/src if you were using windows.

Instead of manually removing the container after the scan, we can use --rm option so docker can clean up after itself.

What is this --user option here, and why are we using it? Can you please try removing this option --user $(id -u):$(id -g) and see what would happen?
