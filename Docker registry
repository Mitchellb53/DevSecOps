Clone repository 
git clone https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/django.nv

Change into app
cd django.nv

Check that dockerfile is present 
cat Dockerfile

Build the image
docker build -t django.nv:1.0 .


Check images after being built
docker images

To store the image, we need the docker repository called registry. We can deploy a registry server locally using the following command.
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2

If the image doesnâ€™t exist, docker will pull automatically from DockerHub

After the registry is up, we can push the image(s), but we need to add the image name with the registry url as a prefix. e.g., REGISTRY_URL/IMAGE_NAME:IMAGE_TAG
docker tag django.nv:1.0 localhost:5000/django.nv:1.0

Then, push the image to the docker registry.
docker push localhost:5000/django.nv:1.0

Then check the image registry using curl 
curl localhost:5000/v2/_catalog

QUESTIONS 

Code to login to the Docker Hub registry via Command Line Interface 
docker login -u your-docker-username -p your-docker-password  OR  docker login 

Push or upload django.nv:1.0 image you created in the previous steps of the exercise to Docker Hub
docker tag django.nv:1.0 dockerhubusername/django.nv:1.0

docker push dockerhubusername/django.nv:1.0=

Stop the registry container and remove the django.nv images to save the disk space
docker stop registry
docker rmi django.nv:1.0
