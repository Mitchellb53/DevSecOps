Install the InSpec package via script.

curl https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -P inspec


Inspec shell is an interactive way to explore Inspec to discover resources you can use to test your configurations.

Before executing the shell, we need to run the below command:

echo "StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new" >> ~/.ssh/config

inspec shell -t ssh://root@prod-p9v0d2l8 -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa --chef-license accept

Inspec shell allows us to quickly run Inspec controls and tests without having to write it to a file. 

This allows us to explore what is available as well as debug profiles.
help

We can run the help resources command to see which resources are available.

help resources

Since Inspec is built using Ruby, we can use Ruby syntax to retrieve out methods available to the file resource.

file('/tmp').class.superclass.instance_methods(false).sort

In addition, we can tap on ruby feature (predicate method) that ends in ?. This returns a Boolean value of True/False.

file('/tmp').directory?

file('/tmp').exist?

file('/tmp').content

You can use the arrow or Page Up and Page Down keys to scroll through the list. When youâ€™re done, press

Q


We are also able to run tests to check if we should include this in subsequent profiles. For example, to check if tmp is a directory created, we can use the following:

describe file('/tmp') do
it { should be_directory }
end
We can also use os_env to test the environment variables for the platform on which the system is running.

os_env('PATH')

os_env('PATH').content

os_env('PATH').split

To exit the Inspec shell session, type exit.

exit
