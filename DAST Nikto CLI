Install Nikto

Nikto is a web server assessment tool. It’s designed to find various default and insecure files, configurations, and programs on any type of web server.

Nikto is built on LibWhisker2 (by RFP) and can run on any platform which has a Perl environment. It supports SSL, proxies, host authentication, attack encoding, and more.

Let’s install Nikto to perform Dynamic Analysis.

apt install -y libnet-ssleay-perl

The above command is needed to support SSL scan in Nikto

git clone https://github.com/sullo/nikto

cd nikto/program

We have successfully installed the Nikto scanner. Let’s explore the functionality it provides us.

./nikto.pl -Help

Run the Scanner
As we have learned in the DevSecOps Gospel, we should save the output in the machine-readable format (CSV, JSON, XML) so it can be parsed by the machines easily.

Let’s run the Nikto with the following options.

./nikto.pl -output nikto_output.xml -h prod-p9v0d2l8

-h: flag used to set the target application which we want to scan
-output: flag used to set the output file in which we want to store the result

Now, executing cat command on the output file will show the nikto result in XML format.

cat nikto_output.xml

List available plugins and run the headers plugin to perform a scan against prod-p9v0d2l8 in Nikto

Hint
To perform the list of plugin in nikto.

./nikto.pl -list-plugins
Then, we can do scanning only in headers plugin.

./nikto.pl -h prod-p9v0d2l8 -Plugins headers

List available plugins and run the headers plugin to perform a scan against prod-p9v0d2l8 in Nikto

Hint
To perform the list of plugin in nikto.

./nikto.pl -list-plugins
Then, we can do scanning only in headers plugin.

./nikto.pl -h prod-p9v0d2l8 -Plugins headers

Configure Nikto (nikto.conf) in /nikto/program/ directory to remove the ports that would never be scanned and save output to CSV format

Hint
Note

Imagine we have a valid use case for not scanning ports 21, 22, and 111, because those ports are required, and the servers running in those ports are adequately secured, we can instruct Nikto to ignore scanning the ports 21, 22, and 111 using SKIPPORTS option.

cat >/nikto/program/nikto.conf<<EOF
SKIPPORTS=21 22 111
CLIOPTS=-output result.csv -Format csv
EOF
Re-run the nikto command.

./nikto.pl -h prod-p9v0d2l8 -config nikto.conf
