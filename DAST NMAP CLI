Let’s install nmap to perform Dynamic Analysis.

We have successfully installed Nmap scanner, let’s explore the functionality it provides us.

nmap -help

Run the Scanner
As we have learned in the DevSecOps Gospel, we should save the output in the machine-readable format so that it can be parsed by the computers easily.

Let’s run nmap with the following options.

nmap prod-p9v0d2l8 -oX nmap_out.xml

-oX: flag used to tells the tool that the output should be saved in XML format

We can check the scan output using the following command

cat nmap_out.xml
