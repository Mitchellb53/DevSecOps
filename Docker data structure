VOLUMES 
To check the list of avalible volumes present 
docker volume ls

Create a volume using the below code 
docker volume create (name) 

The created volume will be located under the /var/lib/docker/volumes/ directory

To append a created volume to a docker container we can use where name is substituted for the created volume name
docker run --name ubuntu -d -v (name):/opt -it ubuntu:18.04

To show persists of data after container deletion we can create a file inside the containers shell and then delete the container 

docker exec -it ubuntu bash
echo "Hello from the containers" > /opt/hello.txt
exit
docker rm -f ubuntu

Then check under the name of the volume in the directory where it is located 
ls /var/lib/docker/volumes/(name)/_data/

The existing volume can be attached to another container on a different path (eg. /tmp) 
docker run --name ubuntu1 -d -v (name):/tmp -it ubuntu:18.04

If we look at the tmp directory we will be able to see the previously deleted data showing persistance 
docker exec -it ubuntu1 ls /tmp
