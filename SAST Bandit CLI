First, we need to download the source code of the project from our git repository.

git clone https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/django.nv webapp

Let’s cd into the application so we can scan the app.

cd webapp

Let’s install the bandit scanner on the system to perform static analysis.

pip3 install bandit==1.7.4

We have successfully installed Bandit scanner. Let’s explore the functionality it provides us.

bandit --help

As we have learned in the DevSecOps Gospel, we would like to store the tool results in a JSON file. We are using the tee command here to show the output and store it in a file simultaneously.

bandit -r . -f json | tee bandit-output.json

Bandit ran successfully, and it found three security issues.
1. One high severity issue
2. One medium severity issue
3. One low severity issue
