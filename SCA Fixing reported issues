Download the source code 

git clone https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/django.nv webapp

Change into app 

cd webapp

Install safety

pip3 install safety=2.3.5

Run the scanner 

safety check -r requirements.txt --json | tee safety-output.json

Fixing the Issues

The tool found many vulnerable components in the source code.

To fix these issues, we would need to see what components are installed in the system by having a look at requirements.txt file.

cat requirements.txt

Only one component needs to be upgraded to fix the issues. You can find out the safe versions of Django by visiting https://pypi.org/project/Django/#history. At the time of writing this exercise, we found the version ___3.2__ of Django does not have any vulnerabilities.

Edit the requirements.txt file to use version 3.2.

cat >requirements.txt<<EOF
Django==3.2
EOF


Run the scanner again to see if the issue persists 
safety check -r requirements.txt --json | tee safety-output.json

No issue should persist as a safe version of Django has been updated in the repositiory
